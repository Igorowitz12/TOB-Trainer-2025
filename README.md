# TOB Trainer 2025 (Verzik Simulator)

A tick-accurate, browser-based Verzik Phase 3 simulator for Theatre of Blood practice and mechanical training.

This project is a **continuation and extension** of the open-source work by [@supalosa](https://github.com/Supalosa) and [@tesla](https://github.com/tesla), based on their `InfernoTrainer` project.  
**TOB Trainer 2025**, maintained by [@Igorowitz12](https://github.com/Igorowitz12) (Xgor), aims to modernize the simulator with new features, custom UI, and high-level PvM training tools.

## ðŸ§  What Is This Project?

Originally created to simulate the Inferno, the `verzik` branch focuses on accurately reproducing **Verzik Vitur Phase 3** logic.  
This fork picks up from there and builds out a fully modular, clientless PvM simulator â€” perfect for learning, practicing, and breaking down Theatre of Blood movement and mechanics with precision.

The long-term goal is a feature-rich Verzik trainer with extensible modules for walking, attack prediction, UI interaction, and combat simulation.
